first,
place this folder on the desktop

second,
run fontforge-console.bat (this only needs to be done once i believe)

third,
run font_generator.bat, you will get like 88 symbols and 1 true type font file.

if you want, open font_generator.bat and edit the arguments for letter_generator.exe.
alternatively, you can use cmd, navigate to the release folder using cd, 
and run letter_generator.exe with arguments via console.

letter_generator.exe 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8
1 is the size of the generated image in the x direction
2 is the size of the generated image in the y direction
3 is the fill probability for the cellular automata
4 is the r1_cutoff
5 is the r2_cutoff
6 is the number of iterations or steps the CA has to complete
7 is the seed number, so you can share cool symbol sets
8 is a rule modifier

just play with the numbers and have fun. 
dont make the width/height too big or have too many iterations/steps or you will have serious slowdown.

run foobar.ttf to install the font and use it in word, it should appear in the fonts list as untitled1.

if you want to generate a new set, delete all the bmps and svgs EXCEPT File_blank.bmp and File_blank.svg. 
also delete the ttf file.

if you have any questions, want to see the sourcecode, plan to use this in a game, 
you can email me at rising.sunny.sun@gmail.com

p.s. troubleshooting, if it isnt working, maybe change the directory in font_script_OLD.txt
